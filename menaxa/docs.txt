Key Mechanics Explained
1. Constant-Sum Model

Shares received always equal net investment (after fees)
This ensures pool solvency: total shares never exceed total pool
Simple and predictable for users

2. Price Discovery Through Pool Ratios

Positive Price = Positive Pool / Total Pool
Negative Price = Negative Pool / Total Pool
Prices always sum to 1.00 USDC

3. Reputation Score Calculation
Score = (Positive Pool - Negative Pool) / Total Pool × 100
- Ranges from -100 (all negative) to +100 (all positive)
- 0 means perfectly balanced pools
4. How Investments Affect Others
When someone invests in POSITIVE:

Increases positive pool → positive price rises
Reputation becomes more positive
Existing positive holders see price appreciation
Existing negative holders see price depreciation

When someone invests in NEGATIVE:

Opposite effect occurs

5. Profit/Loss Dynamics
Winners:

Early investors on the side that becomes dominant
Those who invest when reputation is wrongly skewed

Losers:

Late investors on the losing side
Those who invest at peak reputation extremes

6. Market Equilibrium

The market finds equilibrium when the reputation accurately reflects collective sentiment
Arbitrageurs can profit from extreme reputations by betting against them
The constant-sum model ensures zero-sum dynamics (excluding fees)

7. Strategic Considerations
For Users:

Best entry: When reputation is at extremes but you believe it will reverse
Best exit: When your side has gained dominance
Risk: The crowd can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent

For the Platform:

Fees collected on every investment
No risk exposure (fully collateralized)
Reputation becomes a real-time sentiment indicator

This system creates a dynamic, self-balancing market where company reputation is determined by actual capital allocation rather than votes or ratings, making it costly to manipulate and providing real-time price discovery for reputation value.
